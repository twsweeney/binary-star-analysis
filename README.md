# Binary Star Analysis


This repository contains the code that was used in the development of my final project of Astronomy 480 at the University of Washington in Spring 2023.

In this project my group and I selected W-Uma binary star systems and observed their flux in attempts to determine their orbital periods. The images for this analysis are too large to be uploaded to github and can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hzQ51T6Qh4VlZUaJYXcsJLgocn16p3rm?usp=sharing)

The details of the observation and analysis can be found within the completed paper in this repository.
